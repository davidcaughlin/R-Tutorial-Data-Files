HR Complaint,1,"Yup, I suck. This was from an anonymous note that was slipped under my door when I was on a PTO day. The person also gave the same note to all of the executives. Ironically, this comes a day after another employee gave me a ""thank you for being awesome"" card.

The gist of the note is that we need to get an HR department that is for the employees. The current HR department is only for the company. HR needs to keep employee issues confidential rather than report them like the current HR department.

Backstory, I work for a small family owned business that has been transforming and some people are not on board. We have several employees who are trying to hold onto the old culture that lacked accountability, process,  and where throwing others under the bus was the accepted norm. We have half of our managers who trash talk HR and the executives. They say things like ""I wanted to give you a 5% raise, but COO said no"" or ""HR said you can't work remotely while you are on FMLA (not what I said).""

This company has also had pretty weak HR in the past. In the early days it was a family member who handled transactional HR items. About 10 years ago they hired their first HR Manager with an HR background. People are used to an HR person they can gossip with, will trash talk the executives/company with them, and is more of a ""friend.""  The things that I ""report"" are issues that should not be kept confidential (harassment, theft, etc) and that need to be addressed by the manager or need to have the manager looped in.  We have some employees who expect that they can complain to HR and HR will magically fix the problem or in some instances yell at the CEO and bully them until they give in.

How do I feel? Ok,  I'm not surprised, but it still stings a bit. I know the executives value and respect me as do many of the managers and employees I deal with.

Any guidance on how to work with these population of managers and employees who think HR should be for the people? Is there a way to be ""for the employees,"" but still for ""the company?"""
HR Complaint,2,"I always tell employees I work for everyone, but my main goal is to maintain a compliant workplace. Sometimes that's to the benefit of the employees and other times that the benefit of management. Anytime you start to rock the boat a little and change the wild west culture, this is going to happen."
HR Complaint,3,"I'm not for the company; I'm not for the employees; I am for ""the right thing"".

I will tell the employer they are wrong when making bad decisions.
I will tell the employee they are wrong when making bad decisions.

HR departments that turn a blind eye to employer abuses are wrong.
HR departments that turn a blind eye to employee anarchy are wrong.

Don't be afraid to tell the employer when it's appropriate to make exceptions to company policies.

HR Complaint,4,"Git rid of the managers that are contributing to the problem. Frankly, if this continues you may all be in the unemployment line. Damaged morale, employees acting like children... pretty toxic. Usually that translates into how they conduct business as well - no thanks. There's no room for that kind of shenanigans in today's global marketplace. You can turn it around, it just may take some time. The executive management needs to take control of the situation and start managing the company.

Start with small initiatives, maybe a town hall to convey perceived issues, or  you could do a company survey for anonymity. Then put a plan together and communicate it effectively. Typically with the small companies, the communication is lacking and that is sometimes part of the problem. The whole us vs. them mentality. Implement some lean initiaves, process improvement, etc. Get employees working together with management."
HR Complaint,5,"I would read the note aloud at the next all company meeting in front of everyone.  Let them know that you've considered their feedback and reiterate what you're there to accomplish.  Like every team member here, we're working toward the common company goal.  I likely bring the concerns addressed in this note to leadership in an effort to address them and improve either compliance, productivity or working conditions.  If there are those of you here that aren't willing to continue working to improve the company and our work environments, feel free to let your manager or myself know and we can help you identify opportunities elsewhere where you may be happier.

Further notes of this nature left anonymously will simply be thrown away.  If you would like to have a genuine and open discussion, my door is always open!

Best of luck, feedback like this can sting.  Only you know if you're on the right track so take the note FWIW and I hope your day dramatically improves!"
HR Complaint,6,"I've started with a few company's that never had an HR department and it was always a tough but fun challenge.  One of the first things I do is have a meeting with the leaders then employees to discuss my purpose and agenda in somewhat detail.  I give a few facts about myself - both fun and professional.  My purpose is simply - HR is the champion for the people and guardian of the company.  You are always going to have a few that don't care for you and others that will totally support you.  IMHO, if it is that way, you're doing your job very well.  It does sting when you hear or read that you ""suck"" but that's one negative comment against I bet the 10 good comments you receive.   Mark and Todd also shared some really great insight and advise.  Chin up, you got this!!"
HR Complaint,7,"Brilliantly succinct and straight-forward. I am so stealing this.

HR is the champion for the people and guardian of the company."
HR Complaint,8,"If employees want someone who is ""For them"", they should consider a union.  How dos one think someone paid by the company could be 100% for employees?  I like Todd's I am for the right thing.  Even then if TPTB have no interest in the right thing, HR is left with either leaving or doing something compromising if not out right illegal."
HR Complaint,9,"I know a very popular grocery store that has  company paid employee representatives under HR. There is no union, and this is how they are keeping the union out of the workplace.

HR Complaint,10,"I agree that any time you are trying to make changes, especially company culture changes, you are going to hit some rocky times. It comes with the territory. Keep pushing on though. Keep reminding employees that you are there to be a partner to both the employees and to the business and that sometimes will work in the employee favor and sometimes it won't. Keep reminding executive management that it is important you strive for consistency and actual leadership. Employees need to see that the laws and policies will be upheld consistently for everyone. Work with your managers to get a better understanding of what a true HR manager can do for them and with them. Culture changes take a lot of work and A LOT of nurturing but if you stay consistent in your approach, have compassion where it is warranted and have a tough skin when it's needed, you will see it come more together. You may lose some in the process, but those are the ones who weren't a good idea to begin with and hopefully you can lead it to a better path."
HR Complaint,11,"Did the person actually use the word ""suck""?  I am so sorry this happened to you.  Very unprofessional for the employee to handle it that way.  Sounds like the real problem is from the managers who are blaming others.

I agree with what Todd wrote."
HR Complaint,12,"We are not employee advocates or champions, we are not management advocates or champions. Instead we should be doing what's in the best interest for the company. Sometimes that means advocating for competitive comp and benefit program to attract/retain employees. Other times it means we need to support implementation of restructuring that results in position eliminations. In those cases, we work with management to ensure that the selection process is based on skillsets needed post-restructure, performance and service and NOT based on any discriminatory aspect. We also may recommend separation packages to assist employees in transitioning to new employment.

And so on. I think we are uniquely placed in the organization that we are able to view most aspects of the work environment and provide a healthy and necessary perspective, and wise leadership teams will include us in their strategy and regular business update meetings to have the forum to share our perspective. Employees will recognize that we are poised to advocate for what's best for the company which includes a strong focus on creating a healthy work environment, culture and total rewards program.

HR Complaint,13,I would not give the note a second look and stick it directly in the recycle bin. Some people will always feel the need to complain and place blame. That is not your burden to carry.
HR Complaint,14,HR is there to support the company.  When done correctly - both employees and managers are served and supported.
HR Complaint,15,"The type of company is not relevant.  HR is not primarily an employee advocate.  This is an uninformed individual making a poor attempt at reaching a particular objective.  Your management team is not obliged to respond or take action.  It is possible that the individual may try to unionize down the road.  If successful, the individual will find that the union isn't that great at ""being for the employees"" either."
HR Complaint,16,"I could have written your post myself except that I didn't get a note. I get mean looks by a few employees who recently got classified to a non-exempt status going to the CEO telling them I am too corporate. It does sting, a little and maybe a lot. I did on one occasion tear up as I left for the day.

What is helping me is that I have the support of Senior Leadership. For my managers that are not supportive of the company policies our CEO laid out his expectations and told them they need to manage their staff or not be managers.

I know that am doing my job and if someone comes in to ask a question I will answer it and if they have a problem, I will do my best to help them. If someone gives me the evil eye stare, I have learned to shrug it off. I know that eventually the good I do the company's behalf will be seen by whoever chooses to see it and that no matter what I do some employees will want to blame me as we tend to do that as humans.  At the end of the day what gives me comfort is that I know I did my best as an HR professional."
HR Complaint,17,"Stinks in the format it came in, but ultimately, they confirmed that you are doing your job correctly.  Ignore it."
HR Complaint,18,"I think of it this way:  I am the face of employees to management, and the face of management to employees.

PS - I really like the ""champion of employees and guardian of the company"" as well!"
HR Complaint,19,"I once had a boss who told me that if he didnt get at least one complaint about me a month, I wasn't doing my job.  I would take that note as a badge of honor.  Maybe even put it on my bulletin board for the world to see.  Keep up the good work!
"
HR Complaint,20,"lol yeah I guess I feel indifferent to this post. Some hate me, some love me and that changes issue to issue based on how they benefit. lol I do my work, protect the company and create a legal environment focused on engagement and retention. I am no one's friend here. It's business. When people don't respect HR I've found it's a general lack of a certain type of business experience so I don't put much time into it.

I wouldn't spend any time trying to change them. Work with them on specific issues and that's all you can do."
HR Complaint,21,"?I just want to point out that with one kudos and one complaint, your batting average is 500, which I understand from sporty people is pretty good :). I also want to suggest you put more of your personal energy into the positive note than did into the negative note. Studies show that people are 7x more likely to complain about the service they get than they are to compliment it - so statistically speaking, each ""thank you"" counts 7x more than each ""you suck"" :).

I hope you have an excellent end to your week!

HR Complaint,22,"OP, I could be you.  I didn't get a note but otherwise the same issues here. I just had a discussion and discipline with a problem employee yesterday. In between the lines he told me I was a cold hearted b.... He did not say it out loud, lucky for him. I don't care about him because he had a health scare. I said I do, why would I keep trying to call you, and call your emergency contact if I didn't care.

I believe we work for both sides as long as it is legal, compliant and the right thing to do. I have been an advocate for employees by improving benefits, improve time off, and compensation. I guess they forget about those little things when things don't go their way.

Side note, the person who said I didn't care, told me during our meeting that he had an appointment with his doctor last night. I followed up with him today and asked how it went and he said he never went to the doctor, he doesn't have an appointment scheduled. Yes, I am probably a cold hearted.... because he lies all the time and can't remember his lies when I call him on them."
HR Complaint,23,"im not going to jump on the ""band wagon""

but offer something that will probably serve you as your own feedback.

the only thing I would look at is that obviously there is at least ""one"" person that thinks you are not an employee advocate. when doing the great things you are doing, ask yourself if you are leaning to a particular side more than the other and that should be enough.

there is obviously a perception of you, and unfortunately we wont please everyone, but that also is what opens the door for employees to come to you for help and issues on the floor.

I would not ignore it, but I would not take the ""you suck"" to heart either."

Friends at Work,1,"Hi, HR newbie here so not sure if this is something that isn't really ""my responsibility"" but my company has two sections- one has consultants, one has web developers and 2 ux/ui designers. Our lead web developer just complained over slack to me that he's worried that our new UX designer is unhappy because it's ""too quiet"" in their area. He said he wants her to have someone to talk with during the day (the design team is just her and our lead ux designer and the lead has his own office) and he wants her to have a buddy to talk to and have lunch with etc (their whole team took her to lunch on her first day).

Is this my responsibility? We have a very comfortable office, great view, very modern, nice equipment, we all have enough to do all day, am I responsible for making sure everyone has friends at work? It's quiet because her coworkers are mostly doing coding and they are concentrating."
Friends at Work,2,"No. These are adults who can make their own friends.  And who is to say employees want to be friends.  The employee could be perfectly happy.

You are HR not Match.com for friends."
Friends at Work,3,"Some companies want a social environment, tell the person to hire more people. Your job is not to make sure people have friends at work. Your role as a strategic partner is going to require that during times of discipline you will see how one day you are loved and on another day people hate HR. People are very fickle."
Friends at Work,4,"You are HR not Match.com for friends.

I feel I should print and post in my office door.  This is the best retort I could come up with for""so and so are mean to me"", ""they went to luck and didn't ask me"" complaints."
Friends at Work,5,"I somewhat disagree with the other responses. I don't know that having ""friends"" at work is necessary, but I do think HR can help employees be more engaged by facilitating relationship building among employees. This can be addressed in onboarding by establishing structured programs for mentors, peer ""buddies"" (basically an assigned go to person to help them with navigating their work, the culture, etc), etc."
Friends at Work,6,"I have no interest in forced friendships. You have no way of knowing who will bond or why. You can promote a friendly, team-oriented workplace, but don't starting assigning work buddies."
Friends at Work,7,"Assigning an onboarding ""buddy"" is not an uncommon practice to welcome new employees into the organization to help them navigate the culture, find all the little things that people take for granted after they have been there for awhile (where can I find more paperclips, where are the good places to go to lunch nearby, etc.). Also, facilitating organizational relationships is an important part of building culture.

So while you are not responsible for making sure everyone has friends at work, you are responsible for making sure everyone feels welcome, included and comfortable being part of the team (or has the opportunity to feel that way - some people will be curmudgeons no matter what you do...)"
Friends at Work,8,"This is the correct answer. I'm always concerned by some of the isolationist responses I see here. HR should be promoting an inclusive culture, not a ""I don't need friends at work!"" mentality. People don't need to spend the weekend hanging out with their coworkers, but you spend a minimum of 40 hours per week with these people. For your own emotional well-being, everyone in the company should feel comfortable and welcome around their coworkers not of the opinion ""leave me alone and I'll leave you alone""."
Friends at Work,9,"An onboarding buddy is appropriate, but I didn't take the OP's question to be a reference to onboarding. I think giving new employees a resource is helpful in integration into the team, so if that is the context of the OP, I completely agree.
"
Friends at Work,10,"I hear buddy and I picture someone that has had way too much caffeine stopping by my office constantly asking if things are good, chasing me down as I walk to my car to invite me to lunch and overall just being a pest. (Leslie on Parks and Rec comes to mind)

When I do orientation I cover who a person should go to for XYZ and take them on a tour and introduce them to any key players they will need to know.  I let them know that if they have any questions or need anything in the first few weeks to reach out to me.  From there I hand them off to the manager and it is up to them to get the employee acclimated to the team.

Not sure what else a person could need done upfront."
Friends at Work,11,"It is absolutely not your job to be match maker and get your employees friends. However, I think it is part of my job to make sure people feel welcome at work. With this economy its especially important to do so to reduce turnover.  The others have made some good points. Maybe you should implement a mentor program. So new hires are paired with a mentor to help them navigate their new position. If your employees tend to work in isolated areas where they don't get much social interaction perhaps do potlucks or events to get everyone to mingle. But you need to judge your culture and see if that is something that your employees would enjoy or would hate."
Friends at Work,12,"I think HR needs to help facilitate a new employees first few weeks of employment to make sure they are comfortable in their job, they understand company policies and culture and are generally satisfied with everything. This may include asking how their coworkers are getting along and treating them. It's really sort of a temperature check. I find this makes an employee feel more welcome and a reminder that HR is there. Past that, it's really up to the coworkers within the department to try to make the employee feel welcome and get a team environment going. Perhaps you could suggest a team lunch or after hours event to get them all on the same page. I don't think a forced outing would be advisable because it will likely be more uncomfortable for everyone if they feel like they have to go because the ""new guy"" isn't happy and may lead to more resentment. Other than that, you can't really force people to be friends, get along for work issues and act life professional yes but be friends no. No matter how much it may seem like it, we are not kindergarten teachers and there is no ""buddy bench"" at work."
Friends at Work,13,"?No, you are not."
Friends at Work,14,"Is this my responsibility? We have a very comfortable office, great view, very modern, nice equipment, we all have enough to do all day, am I responsible for making sure everyone has friends at work? It's quiet because her coworkers are mostly doing coding and they are concentrating.

"
Friends at Work,15,"No.  Just no.

And for those touting that it's HR responsibility to help people make friends at work....  HR is not, nor should it ever be the ""cruise director"" of the workplace.  We can help enable an inclusive friendly culture.  But an inclusive, friendly culture is the responsibility of every single employee - especially anyone in a leadership or management position.

This is not pre-school.  Adults in the workplace should have a rough idea of how to introduce themselves to others and start a conversation.  And if a company wants a buddy system for new hires - that task is the manager's responsibility, not HR.

It's not isolationist.  It's about expecting leaders to lead and all employees to behave like grownups.

 -- If you treat employees like adults, they'll act like adults."
Friends at Work,16,"No this is not your responsibility. It's also normal to have a quiet office. A lot of people enjoy the ""quiet"" to focus on work.

I would thank him for his concern but ask him to provide you with specific examples that show the employee is unhappy."
Friends at Work,17,"Typically, management complains about people socializing too much at work.
This person is concerned employees are working independently.

Crazy.  Friendships (lunch buddies) will develop over time if that is what the employees are interested in.

Me?  I'd rather be left alone to get my job completed and no, I have no interest in having a lunch buddy.

Perhaps she feels the same way as well."
Friends at Work,18,"?It is your responsibility if you are concerned about employee engagement. One of the 12 engagement factor questions is ""I have a friend at work."""
Friends at Work,19,"I suggest a different perspective for the issue raised by the lead web developer - rather than the perspective/question ""is it my (HR's) responsibility?"", I suggest engaging the lead web developer in defining the organizational/business problem first, then collaborate on potential solutions/improvements.

If the lead web developer is concerned that the new UX designer is unhappy, what led him to that conclusion?  What has he observed or heard from the new employee that he is characterizing as ""unhappy""?  If the new employee specifically mentioned that she is unhappy with the work environment because it's too quiet, did the lead web developer engage the new employee in some ideas or suggestions to address the ""too quiet"" environment?

That said, the lead web developer's ideas for having people to talk to, go to lunch with may have merit - not only for new hires but the whole team.  I don't have experience in web development, but in my experience in a high-tech industry, taking small breaks for informal chats, and chatting with team members on a work-related topic is very helpful for problem-solving, innovations, and quickly sharing lessons learned/best practices.

So, I don't see this a a sole HR responsibility, but an opportunity for HR to partner.  Hope it works out!"
Friends at Work,20,"OP here, thank you all for your helpful responses, I appreciate it!"
Friends at Work,21,"I'll keep it simple:

HELL TO THE NO.

You are not the buddy committee."
Friends at Work,22,"""HR should be promoting an inclusive culture, not a 'I don't need friends at work!' mentality."" Ditto! This does not mean HR has to ensure that everyone has a best friend at work.

The buddy system only works when there are a sufficient number of competent leads that are not management and who volunteer for this task, who answer questions and show new folks around their first few weeks or months. But they don't have to remain hooked at the hip indefinitely. Usually the ""buddy"" gets a tiny bonus or stipend for doing this.

Every organization has a different culture and environment, usually rather dependent upon the industry. Regardless, HR is not responsible for finding everyone a bestie. From the description I read from OP I'd suggest regular get together lunches for everyone in the department (monthly perhaps, certainly more often than merely when a new person joins the team) to foster some camaraderie but not disrupt the actual work. This might placate the worrying lead web developer that you are taking appropriate steps and their entire team might benefit. Who knows, you might start a positive trend in your company. Best of luck here!"
